# Odin Recipes

This repository contains my first project for **The Odin Project**. In this project, I am building a basic recipe website using only HTML to practice my foundational HTML skills.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a simple website where I will display various recipes. It is designed to help reinforce the basic structure and syntax of HTML as I progress through **The Odin Project** course.

## Structure

The website consists of:

- A homepage with links to individual recipe pages
- Individual pages for each recipe, which include ingredients and steps

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of HTML. After completing **The Odin Project** course, I plan to revisit and improve this project with additional styling and functionality.

## Future Improvements

Once I finish this course, I plan to:

1. Add CSS to style the website and make it more visually appealing.
2. Implement additional features, possibly using JavaScript, to enhance interactivity.
