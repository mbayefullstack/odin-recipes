    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>African seafood and okra soup from the African country of Senegal is a traditional African food recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 mussels (or frozen on the half-shell)</li>
        <li>3 quarts fish or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 or 4 tablespoons fish sauce (as a substitute for fermented conch called “yeett”)</li>
        <li>1 Scotch bonnet</li>
        <li>16 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>8 oz lump crabmeat, picked over for any shells</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons palm oil</li>
        <li>8 cups thinly-sliced okra</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Cooked fonio or rice, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using fresh mussels: place the mussels in a colander in the sink under running water. Scrub with a clean brush to remove grit. Gently try to close any open mussels with your fingers or gently tap the open mussels on a counter; discard any that do not close. Sometimes, the mussel comes with a “beard.” To remove it, grab it with your fingers and pull it out. You can also use a knife.</li>
        <li>Bring the stock to a boil in a 6 quart saucepan over high heat, then add the bay leaves and onions. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the stock has reduced by one-quarter, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the fish sauce and the chiles to the broth. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the mussels and shrimp. Cover the pan and cook until the mussels open and shrimp are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened by this time.</li>
        <li>Add the crabmeat and palm oil. Cook for approximately 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add okra and stir once. Cook at a simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and serve over fonio or rice.</li>
    </ol>
