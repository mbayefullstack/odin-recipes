    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Thieboudienne, Ceebu Jën or chebu jen (Wolof: ceebu jën; French: thiéboudiène) is prepared with fish, broken rice and tomato sauce cooked in one pot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup canola or palm oil</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 (12-oz.) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>6 cups fish or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>6 small carrots, halved crosswise</li>
        <li>1 large eggplant, cut into large chunks, or 4 small Thai eggplants</li>
        <li>1 medium turnip, peeled and cut into 12 wedges</li>
        <li>1/2 cassava root, peeled and cut into 1 1/2″ chunks</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dried white hibiscus flowers (optional; see below for ordering)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. tamarind paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. fish sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the fish and stuffing: Mix together parsley, chile flakes, garlic, scallion, onion, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Using a paring knife, cut a 2″ slit lengthwise in each fish filet; stuff filets with the herb mixture, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the thiéboudienne: Heat oil in an 8-qt. Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and green pepper, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and paste is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add stock, and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, and add filets; cook until fish is just cooked through, about 18 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove filets and transfer to a plate, then cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, eggplants, turnips, and cassava, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a bowl; keep warm. Add hibiscus flowers (if using), tamarind paste, and fish sauce, and cook, stirring occasionally, until hibiscus flowers soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add rice, and stir to combine; reduce heat to low, and cook, covered, until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat, and fluff rice with a fork.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide fish, vegetables, and rice among serving plates; serve with lime wedges (for squeezing over fish).</li>
    </ol>
